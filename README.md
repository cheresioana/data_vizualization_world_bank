# data_vizualization_world_bank

My project on data vizualization focuses on the correlation between different aspects
of countries. The main focus of this work is around the literacy levels and
the internet use: their correlation, connection with other economical aspects and social
implications of the findings.

Dataset

The World Bank dataset is an organization that coordinates statistical and data work and
maintains a number of macro, financial and sector databases. Working closely with the Bankâ€™s
regions and Global Practices, the group is guided by professional standards in the collection,
compilation and dissemination of data to ensure that all data users can have confidence in the
quality and integrity of the data produced. Each year, they provide multiple datasets that are
then used to evaluate and analyze different aspects from an economical and cultural
perspective that are general and influence day to day lives.


Conclusions

The study shows aspects that influence the literacy levels and the
internet use in different countries. By using different methods of data vizualization, the link
between economical and cultural aspects of the countries can be seen as a whole, and
conclusions can be drawn.
